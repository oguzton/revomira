        <div>
          <h3>Platform Integrations (OAuth Services)</h3>
          <p>
            To provide review management services, we integrate with third-party review platforms (such as Google My
            Business, TripAdvisor, Booking.com, and similar services). When you connect these platforms to your account:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We use OAuth 2.0 authentication protocols to securely access these platforms on your behalf.</li>
            <li>We do NOT store your login credentials. We only request and store encrypted OAuth access tokens.</li>
            <li>
              These encrypted access tokens allow us to retrieve only your review data. We have no direct access to your
              account or other data.
            </li>
            <li>Access tokens are encrypted and stored securely. We do not share them with third parties.</li>
            <li>You can disconnect any platform integration at any time via account settings.</li>
            <li>
              The review data we retrieve is stored securely in our systems and receives the same privacy protections as
              other data we collect.

            topic detection, and response suggestions. When you use our AI analysis features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review text content is sent to AI providers with strong data protection practices.</li>
            <li>We only send the text necessary for analysis, and no extra personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li>
              AI providers process this data according to their privacy policies and are obligated to use it only for our
              analysis requests.
            </li>
            <li>Providers do not retain your review data for training or any other purpose.</li>
            <li>

              providers.
